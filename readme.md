## Overview

Application includes:

- Pomodoro technique countdown with ability to pause, choose preferred learn/break time and number of rounds

**In future:**

- Responsive GUI and more styling
- ~~TODO list~~
- Summary of the learning time and completed todos while learning.
- ~~Validation of user inputs~~
- I will review the code and make sure that its clear, well commented and if needed I will refactor it

## Demo video - delays are caused by refreshing the timer

## Idea of the project

I started this project because I wanted to practice Python coding with tkinter module and just for myself to be able to use it while learning
